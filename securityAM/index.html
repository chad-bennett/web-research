A Valiant Effort to Finish a
Security Threat Drawing in a Timely Manner &copy; Chandler Pellerito</p>

<p>Security threats have become an increasing issue in the modern day.  We all know about the scammers and viruses from many other sources.  These are great examples why security threats are becoming a major issue.  Some examples and their form of attacking will be listed.</p>
<h2 id="viruses">Viruses</h2>
<p>This is one of the more infamous forms of computer attacks in which it will attack your computer and damages what it has.  Some viruses can be more catastrophic than others.  Some may only infect a certain file while others brake the computer completely.  Stay far away form these.</p>
<h2 id="hackers">Hackers</h2>
<p>A form of attack, these will attempt to breach through your security and rob you of your valuables.  These can be especially troublesome for businesses.  Make sure you have a good firewall and security.  This is important for your safety.</p>
<h2 id="phishing">Phishing</h2>
<p>Almost as it sounds like.  These people will try to lull you into giving information.  He or she will attempt to hide him or herself as a different person or business and talk you into giving information that he or she wants.  If you're like me, than you are already avoiding them by never checking your email.</p>
<h2 id="spam">Spam</h2>
<p>Spam is somewhat similar to phishing.  It just takes up space in your email and causes plenty of clutter.  These usually aren't a problem, though it is possible for them to contain links.  These links should be left alone, for they can lead to hackers and viruses.</p>
