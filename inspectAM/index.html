<p>So, in browser development tools are means of editing a web page inside the very own browser. This means that one could potentially edit certain elements of a certain website via what most people, including my 7 year old underdeveloped mind, call the it "inspect tool" when you left click anywhere on your webpage.</p>
<p>The Inspect Tool does many things, but it acts mostly as a tool for website development inside the browser. The Inspect Tool lets you access many things such as the source code of the websites which is basically the "bread and butter" of a website. The Inspect Tool also uses HTML type format, also you can access things like the console, sources of the page, Network, page styles, Breakpoints, Properties and accessibility. But we'll talk about all that later.</p>
<p>But before i talk about all the cool and inappropriate things you can do with the inspect tool and other in browser devtools, I'm going to bring up the difference of the inspect tool between Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome. Surprisingly enough, while perhaps being the inferior browser, it seems as if Mozilla Firefox has a better in browser devtool. The Firefox browser has seemingly a lot more features than the built in google chrome tool. It has features such as letting you edit "pseudo-Elements" which is something I haven't seen within chrome. Theres just so much more accessibility to the firefox devtool than the chrome one. You can also set certain Animations to an element of the webpage. If chrome does have these things, it doesnt make it known, with my research at least.</p>
<p>The things you can do with the "Inspect Tool" are relatively tame from what I've seen. I mean yeah, you can change elements of the text if you access the source code but it doesn't matter very much its not like your sabotaging anybody's website, changes made wont be enacted on anyone else's monitor except for your own. I suppose you could steal source code with it, or just modify the code for your own liking. Here's an example- this is the element for the video player on YouTube:</p>
