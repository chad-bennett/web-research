<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>By definition the Internet is a worldwide, publicly accessible series  of interconnected computer networks that transmit data by packet  switching using the standard Internet Protocol. How did this technology  come to be so popular and so widely used around the world? Was it always  so large and extensive, filled with information about just about  anything you can possibly imagine and accessible from almost anywhere,  anytime? The answer is no and it is important to understand where it  came from to understand how to utilize it to its fullest potential now.</p>
<h3 id="creation">Creation</h3>
<p>The Internet’s origin have their roots in a military project, the  Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) program, which networked  country-wide radar systems together for the first time. This was created  around 1958 as part of an attempt to regain the lead in technology from  the Soviet Union which had recently launched Sputnik.</p>
<p>J.C.R. Licklider was selected to head the committee which controlled  the SAGE project. He envisioned universal networking as a unifying human  revolution. Licklider recruited Lawrence Roberts to head a project  which implemented a network. Roberts had worked with the U.S. Air Force  on a packet switching system as opposed to a circuit switching system.  On October 29, 1969, Licklider and Roberts interconnected the first two  nodes between UCLA and SRI International at Menlo Park, California. This  was the beginning of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network  (ARPANET) which was one of the key networks which our Internet today was  based off of. Soon after the first international packet-switched  network service was created between U.S. and U.K.</p>
<p>In 1984, the National Science Foundation (NSF) commissioned the  construction of a 1.5 megabit/second network which became known as  NSFNET. In 1989 the US Federal Networking Council approved the  interconnection of the NSFNET to the commercial MCI Mail system. Soon  after, other commercial e-mail services were connected such as OnTyme,  Telemail, and CompuServe. Three Internet Service Providers (ISPs) were  also created: UUNET, PSINET, and CERFNET. More and more seperate  networks were created that eventually interconnected with this large,  growing network of networks.The ability of TCP/IP to work over virtually  any pre-existing communication networks allowed for a great ease of  growth, although the rapid growth of the Internet was due primarily to  the availability of commercial routers from companies such as Cisco  Systems, Proteon and Juniper, the availability of commercial Ethernet  equipment for local-area networking and the widespread implementation of  TCP/IP on the UNIX operating system.</p>
<h3 id="growth">Growth</h3>
<p>The Internet is defined as the worldwide interconnection of  individual networks operated by government, industry, academia, and  private parties. Originally the Internet served to interconnect  laboratories engaged in government research, and since 1994 it has been  expanded to serve millions of users and a multitude of purposes in all  parts of the world. In a matter of very few years, the Internet consolidated itself as a  very powerful platform that has changed forever the way we do business,  and the way we communicate. The Internet, as no other communication  medium, has given an International or, if you prefer, a “Globalized”  dimension to the world. Internet has become the Universal source of  information for millions of people, at home, at school, and at work. The Internet continues to be the most democratic of all the mass media.  With a very low investment, anyone can have a web page in Internet. This  way, almost any business can reach a very large market, directly, fast  and economically, no matter the size or location of the business. With a  very low investment, almost anybody that can read and write can have  access and a presence in the World Wide Web. Blogging has consolidated  the social media and the people everywhere are expressing and publishing  their ideas and opinions like never before.</p>
<h3 id="todays-internet">Today’s Internet</h3>
<p>Internet is very famous nowadays for satisfying people with various  services related to various different fields. It is a very versatile  facility which can help you in completing many tasks easily and  conveniently with few clicks. It can be any work of daily usage or any  specific service which needs a lot of research and formalities to be  done beforehand. Almost everything is now available over internet in  this age of advancement of technologies. It is in general practice  nowadays for a person to look for a particular solution over there and  getting satisfied with the appropriate solution. You can pay your bills  online and purchase various items by going through various websites and  choosing among a variety of options. One can get information on any  particular thing around the world using internet facility.</p>
