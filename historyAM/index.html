<h2 id="early-development">Early Development</h2>
<p>To begin, the history of the internet is a long one and it all started with the need for better national security. Before the internet was invented computers were huge, bulky and practically immobile. The only way information could be sent digitally, was through telephone lines or magnetic computer tapes that had to send sent through the mail. In light of the Cold War the Department of Defense began to realize that their communication systems were susceptible to Russian attacks.</p>
<p>In response to this threat the Department of Defense created a system of connected computers that became known as ARPAnet or the ARPA Network (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network.) This (at the time) obscure government research project would soon become the earliest version of the internet.</p>
<h2 id="the-beginning-of-the-internet">The Beginning of the Internet</h2>
<p>While ARPAnet was an amazing invention it was currently only being used by the Department of Defense and a few other government agencies. So in October 1972 ARPAnet was publicly demonstrated for the first time at the International Computer Conference in Washington DC. This would eventually lead to the creation of the International Networking Group chaired by Vint Cerf. Then by 1975 the first official, public prototype was being tested. Eventually in 1978, after a few more years of testing, TCP/IPv4 was released.
While many consider the birth of the internet to be in January 1983, when the Defense Data Network officially switched to the TCP/IP (Transport Control Protocol - Internet Protocol) standard. ARPAnet was an important step since it helped develop/create email, packet switching, and assisted in the creation of the TCP/IP.</p>
<h2 id="further-development">Further Development</h2>
<p>By 1998 there were over 750,000 commercial sites and businesses operating on the World Wide Web, but it wasn’t an instant success. In the beginning, the internet only provided pages upon pages of text and it was often only available in one font and size. While some companies began to develop GUIs (graphical user interfaces) the internet was still quite bland. Arguably, one of the most important developments was Tim Berners Lee’s development of the  hypertext transfer protocol (http.) This protocol gave diverse computer platforms the ability to access the same websites as everyone else. Another important development included the development of the URL or Uniform Resource Locator. This made it much easier to find and access websites by creating a unique URL for every website.</p>
<p>Then in the 1990’s Tim Berners Lee brought this all together and created the World Wide Web. In 1991 web browsers and web server software first became available and by the end of 1992 there were approximately 26 websites in existence. Within 60 years this obscure government research project went from 0 to over 3.2 billion users.</p>
