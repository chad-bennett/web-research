(turning messages into secret code) --based on the very old art of (the science of making secret codes)--uses computers and sets of computer instructions to turn plain text into an unreadable, jumbled code. To (change secret codes into readable messages) that ciphertext into plaintext, you need a number-based key to secretly code messages, a series of bits that(change secret code into understandable language) the text. The key is something only you or themeant receiver has in their possession. Computers are capable of breaking (turned into secret code) code by guessing a number-based key to secretly code messages, but for very fancy (or smart) sets of computer instructions like an elliptic curve set of computer instructions, this could take a very, very long time. If you send a secret/unreadable email, only the person with the number-based key to secretly code messages can read it. If you're using a secret/unreadable internet connection to shop online, your information and credit card number are hidden from unauthorized users, like computer criminals, illegal (secretly recording/watching people), or identity thieves. If you (turn into secret code) data before syncing it with the cloud, the cloud--or anyone breaking into it--can't read that data. But (turning messages into secret code) can be used for bad, too. Ransomware attacks are becoming more common, also called denial of service (DOS) attacks that use (turning messages into secret code) software to lock users out of their computers until they pay a fee. WHOLE DISKS- Whole disk (turning messages into secret code), as the name hints, refers to the (turning messages into secret code) of a whole physical or logical disk. While this is now done mostly with software, hardware based disk (turning messages into secret code) is a growing technology which is expected to go past software products for whole disk (turning messages into secret code) over the next few years. This form of (turning messages into secret code) generally (turns into secret code) the whole contents of a disk or volume and (changes secret codes into readable messages)/encrypts it during use after a key has been given. This means the data is protected from situations like laptop/disk loss or theft where the data would be (turned into secret code)and require a key to (change secret codes into readable messages). It would not protect from situations like sending information over the network (e-mail, websites, etc) or from situations where the (changing secret codes into readable messages) key was already entered such as the user walking away from their logged-in computer. Single- user file/folder level- When an individual wishes to (turn into secret code) a single file or group of files there are (more than two, but not a lot of) options. Most (turning messages into secret code) software has the ability to (turn into secret code) files individually using a password or other key. Many (turning messages into secret code) programs have the ability to create a secret/unreadable \"virtual drive\". This is a secret/unreadable file that, when opened with the key, looks like another drive attached to the computer allowing the user to easily open and save files into a secret/unreadable area. Some other (online or paper forms that ask for a job, money, admission, etc.), like MS Office And OpenOffice, have built-in, single-file (turning messages into secret code) features. 2 MULTI- User File/ Folder Level- Allowing many users to (at the same time) access (turned into secret code) information is more complicated than a single user. The (turning messages into secret code) software must allow the use of either many keys (i.e. one for each user) or a shared key (e.g. a shared password). Also, the software must deal with multi-user file locking issues (this is usually a problem with the virtual drive approach talked about/said in the last section). This approach can provide an added layer of protection against the (telling to people/making known) of highly private data on file servers in the event they are damaged/agreed. It can also help protect against (telling to people/making known) on backup media as the files would remain(turned into secret code) when backed up. This approach can get complicated if not all users have the (turning messages into secret code)software installed, or they are not configured regularly (all the time). This could lead users being unable to access secret/unreadable information or wrongly believing they have (turned into secret code) information when they have not. For these reasons, special attention should be paid to how (turning messages into secret code) software behaves and users should be educated to recognize the (turning messages into secret code) status of files. DATABASE- (turning into secret code) information in a (computer file full of information) can be done at a couple of levels. The computer program (using/getting to) the (computer file full of information)can (turn into secret code) information before putting it into the (computer file full of information). This needs/demands intelligence at the application level, but no added/more(computer file full of information) features. Many (computer files full of information) have built-in(turning messages into secret code) functions which computer programs can use to (turn into secret code) data as it is written. This usually needs/demands features at both the computer program and (computer file full of information) level. A (turning messages into secret code)computer program can sit between the computer program and (computer file full of information), (turn into secret code)ing/decrypting information as it is written and read. This Needs/demands buying and installing added/more software, but may not require changes to the computer program or (computer file full of information). DB (combined different things together so they worked as one unit) (turning messages into secret code) DB backed application level (turning messages into secret code) Application Level- As talked about/said earlier, some computer programs that aren't specifically designed for(turning messages into secret code) do have basic (turning messages into secret code) functions. Especially, common working well and getting a lot done suites like Microsoft Office and OpenOffice contain file (turning messages into secret code) features. Be careful of the quality of the built-in (turning messages into secret code) features, even within the Microsoft Office product line, some versions (like Office 2007) have a good (machine/method/way), others have poor ones(like Office 2000 and earlier) and still others require proper setup to provide good protection (like Office 2003). These features can be very (conveniently nearby/useful) because they don't require added/more licenses, require less training and can be effective for both traveling and at rest(turning messages into secret code). Also, they can work well for file exchange since the receiver is more likely to have the ability to (change secret codes into readable messages) the file. In short, built-in (turning messages into secret code) functions can be convenient options, but you should research their effectiveness before using them. Email Messages- There are a couple of different levels to (turning messages into secret code) with email, first is(turning into secret code) just a political helpers file and second is (turning into secret code) a whole message. (turning into secret code) a political helpers file can be completed using a single-file (turning messages into secret code) process that \"sticks\" to the file. Naturally, the receiver must have a way of (changing secret codes into readable messages) the file. There are only a couple of commonly used email message (turning messages into secret code)technologies, especially S/MIME and PGP. While S/MIME support is (having different things working together as one unit) into many email clients, it needs/demands users to have trusted certificates which can be complicated to properly send out and use. Using PGP to (turn into secret code) email needs/demands installing software, but there are both free and commercial options. Both of these technologies also allow for digital \"signing\" of email without (turning into secret code) it. This signing process allows the receiver to be certain a message was not changed traveling, but does not protect the content from prying eyes. PGP/GnuPG Email clients with (combined different things together so they worked as one unit) S/MIME support Network Traffic- (turning into secret code) information while traveling on a network is one of the most common, and important, uses of (turning messages into secret code). One of the most popular forms of this (turning messages into secret code) is Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security(TLS), commonly used to (turn into secret code) web traffic traveling. Any web computer program that transmits or collects sensitive information should (turn into secret code) the information using SSL/TLS. There are some other uses for SSL/TLS (turning messages into secret code), including securing (verifying someone's identity) for email communication between clients and servers. SSL/TLS can also be used for \"tunneling\" to (turn into secret code) other forms of network transmission that don't have their own (turning messages into secret code) features. Another common network (turning messages into secret code) technology is Secure Shell (SSH) which is mostly used for secret/unreadable terminal connections (replacing telnet) and (turned into secret code) file moves (from one place to another) (SFTP replacing FTP). Like SSL/TLS, SSH can also be used for tunneling. A more general form of network traffic (turning messages into secret code) is IP Security (IPSec), which operates at a more basic layer than SSL or SSH and can be applied to any network traffic. However, using IPSec needs/demands common setup between the two computers communicating, so it is generally used within a company/department rather than across the internet. For wireless networks there are other (turning messages into secret code) options that only (turn into secret code) information between the computer and the wireless access point. For this reason, they only protect from (secretly watching and recording) on wireless and not after the information leaves the access point onto a wired network. The two most common forms are called Wired Equal Privacy (WEP) and WiFI Protected Access (WPA). WEP is no longer carefully thought about/believed a secure rules of conduct. WPA is much stronger, but has faults/problems and an updated WPA2 standard has been released which improves its security. resources introduction to encryption and data security types of encryption","title":"encryption"},{"location":"encryptAM/#encryption","text":"by Willow Herban image design \u00a9 Willow Herban","title":"Encryption"},{"location":"encryptAM/#how-does-it-work-turning-messages-into-secret-code","text":"--based on the very old art of (the science of making secret codes)--uses computers and sets of computer instructions to turn plain text into an unreadable, jumbled code.

One of the most popular forms of this (turning messages into secret code) is Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security(TLS), commonly used to (turn into secret code) web traffic traveling. Any web computer program that transmits or collects sensitive information should (turn into secret code) the information using SSL/TLS. There are some other uses for SSL/TLS (turning messages into secret code), including securing (verifying someone's identity) for email communication between clients and servers. SSL/TLS can also be used for \"tunneling\" to (turn into secret code) other forms of network transmission that don't have their own (turning messages into secret code) features. Another common network (turning messages into secret code) technology is Secure Shell (SSH) which is mostly used for secret/unreadable terminal connections (replacing telnet) and (turned into secret code) file moves (from one place to another) (SFTP replacing FTP). Like SSL/TLS, SSH can also be used for tunneling. A more general form of network traffic (turning messages into secret code) is IP Security (IPSec), which operates at a more basic layer than SSL or SSH and can be applied to any network traffic. However, using IPSec needs/demands common setup between the two computers communicating, so it is generally used within a company/department rather than across the internet. For wireless networks there are other (turning messages into secret code) options that only (turn into secret code) information between the computer and the wireless access point.

They take your signal and send it to servers that direct it to the desired location. They collect data from websites and send it back to you so you can access the selected website. Routers, servers, and various other hardware all work together to connect one computer to another. Hardware at a Campus or Large Space When connecting to the internet at a campus or something of the like, there is a gateway which connects net segments and will convert protocols allowing other networks to talk with the internet. From there the signal goes to a router which actively directs internet traffic to the next station. Then it goes to a bridge where it keeps local traffic and passes non-local traffic. It could also go to a repeater which echos or amplifies signals between two pieces of a local network. Hardware at Home First you have the wireless router, which is the hub where all of the computers and devices connect to. They are technically gateways, not routers, but they are called routers anyways. From there if you have a wireless NIC (network information card), you can connect to the internet. Laptops come with these but desktops do not have one installed. Alternatively, you can connect via ethernet cord which directly connects your computer and the router, connecting you to the internet. Now your computer and the servers can communicate. Servers A server is a computer, a device, or a program that is dedicated to managing network resources. They are usually called dedicated because they don't do anything other than their server tasks. Servers accept and responds to requests made by another program, known as a client. They allow you to send texts, access websites, play games with your friends, etc. most servers are never turned off meaning that when a server goes down, it can cause companies and individuals trouble.

Before the internet was invented computers were huge, bulky and practically immobile. The only way information could be sent digitally, was through telephone lines or magnetic computer tapes that had to send sent through the mail. In light of the Cold War the Department of Defense began to realize that their communication systems were susceptible to Russian attacks. In response to this threat the Department of Defense created a system of connected computers that became known as ARPAnet or the ARPA Network (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network.) This (at the time) obscure government research project would soon become the earliest version of the internet. The Beginning of the Internet While ARPAnet was an amazing invention it was currently only being used by the Department of Defense and a few other government agencies. So in October 1972 ARPAnet was publicly demonstrated for the first time at the International Computer Conference in Washington DC. This would eventually lead to the creation of the International Networking Group chaired by Vint Cerf. Then by 1975 the first official, public prototype was being tested. Eventually in 1978, after a few more years of testing, TCP/IPv4 was released. While many consider the birth of the internet to be in January 1983, when the Defense Data Network officially switched to the TCP/IP (Transport Control Protocol - Internet Protocol) standard. ARPAnet was an important step since it helped develop/create email, packet switching, and assisted in the creation of the TCP/IP. Further Development By 1998 there were over 750,000 commercial sites and businesses operating on the World Wide Web, but it wasn\u2019t an instant success. In the beginning, the internet only provided pages upon pages of text and it was often only available in one font and size. While some companies began to develop GUIs (graphical user interfaces) the internet was still quite bland. Arguably, one of the most important developments was Tim Berners Lee\u2019s development of the hypertext transfer protocol (http.) This protocol gave diverse computer platforms the ability to access the same websites as everyone else. Another important development included the development of the URL or Uniform Resource Locator. This made it much easier to find and access websites by creating a unique URL for every website. Then in the 1990\u2019s Tim Berners Lee brought this all together and created the World Wide Web. In 1991 web browsers and web server software first became available and by the end of 1992 there were approximately 26 websites in existence. Within 60 years this obscure government research project went from 0 to over 3.2 billion users.

Was it always so large and extensive, filled with information about just about anything you can possibly imagine and accessible from almost anywhere, anytime? The answer is no and it is important to understand where it came from to understand how to utilize it to its fullest potential now. Creation The Internet\u2019s origin have their roots in a military project, the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) program, which networked country-wide radar systems together for the first time. This was created around 1958 as part of an attempt to regain the lead in technology from the Soviet Union which had recently launched Sputnik. J.C.R. Licklider was selected to head the committee which controlled the SAGE project. He envisioned universal networking as a unifying human revolution. Licklider recruited Lawrence Roberts to head a project which implemented a network. Roberts had worked with the U.S. Air Force on a packet switching system as opposed to a circuit switching system. On October 29, 1969, Licklider and Roberts interconnected the first two nodes between UCLA and SRI International at Menlo Park, California. This was the beginning of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) which was one of the key networks which our Internet today was based off of. Soon after the first international packet-switched network service was created between U.S. and U.K. In 1984, the National Science Foundation (NSF) commissioned the construction of a 1.5 megabit/second network which became known as NSFNET. In 1989 the US Federal Networking Council approved the interconnection of the NSFNET to the commercial MCI Mail system. Soon after, other commercial e-mail services were connected such as OnTyme, Telemail, and CompuServe. Three Internet Service Providers (ISPs) were also created: UUNET, PSINET, and CERFNET. More and more seperate networks were created that eventually interconnected with this large, growing network of networks.The ability of TCP/IP to work over virtually any pre-existing communication networks allowed for a great ease of growth, although the rapid growth of the Internet was due primarily to the availability of commercial routers from companies such as Cisco Systems, Proteon and Juniper, the availability of commercial Ethernet equipment for local-area networking and the widespread implementation of TCP/IP on the UNIX operating system. Growth The Internet is defined as the worldwide interconnection of individual networks operated by government, industry, academia, and private parties. Originally the Internet served to interconnect laboratories engaged in government research, and since 1994 it has been expanded to serve millions of users and a multitude of purposes in all parts of the world.

Web client and web server connects with each other and cannot exist without the other. To sum things up web client is a consumers application that sends a request to the servers and receives and projects a friendly interface for the end user.

History With the introduction of images to the web in early 1991, the popularity and uses of the m as a digital tool are so far reaching that few websites do not use them. One of the first images put on the web was a Italian parody band by the name of Les Horribles Cernettes.

These images all have a place, whether it be on a server or a local computer. The focus on compression. Forms of compression were and still are one of the most important methods of preserving storage and increasing buffering speeds. The two forms of compression that are primarily used on the web are Lossy and Lossless Compression. They are able to reduce the size of the data required to transfer, thus the application of this can be beneficial for the sites that require imagery. The focus on compression. Forms of compression were and still are one of the most important methods of preserving storage and increasing buffering speeds. The two forms of compression that are primarily used on the web are Lossy and Lossless Compression.

What Are Responsive Images? Responsive Images are Images that are able to expand or contract with the size of the webpage, allowing for more complete mobile experiences. This allows users on all platforms to adjust sites to a manageable size with ease, as well as viewing easier. Methods to go about doing this are simply adjusting in the HTML description of the image itself.

A computer programmer (or several computer programmers) write the instructions using a programming language that tell the software how to function and what to do. Once the program has been completed, it is compiled into a language that the computer can understand. There are many components that are important in order to run the internet, and without these systems computers would be useless. Internet Browser Software A browser is a program created as a way to present and explore content on the World Wide Web. This content is connected using hyperlinks and are classified with URLs. Hyperlinks are objects in a document that take you to another file or object if you click on them. URLs are the ways to classify or name documents on the internet. Basically, on an internet browser, different URLs are different documents, and they can be connected using hyperlinks. Operating System The operating system of a computer a is software program that enables the computer hardware to communicate and operate with the computer software. A graphical user interface (GUI) uses icons that are easy to read to help people use the internet more simply. Instead of having to type commands into a command line, the computer shows people where to type and does the rest of the work for them. With GUI, users don\u2019t have to memorize any commands or computer languages. All Together The internet is the way it is because of internet software. Without internet software, if a person wanted to use the internet, they would have to type in each command individually. This would take a very long time.
