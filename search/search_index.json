You can find your assigned research topic here. RESEARCH INFORMATION Create a folder in your google folder called Research Project . All of your research artifacts will go here. Things to collect include: information about topic & explanation writing to make sense of the information relevant imagery (save the images themselves and include links to sources) at least four web sources of information (include links to the sources) WRITTEN POST Using our research, you will create a written informational post explaining your topic in enough detail that a casual reader would understand. For the most part you will be explaining specialized vocabulary. Your written post will be at least four paragraphs long, but it will probably be longer. Focusing on capturing the important information, not paragraph count. Your written post will be formatted and saved as a markdown file , which is a special text file. You can use this file as a template for how to format your content. Since markdown is just a special text file, you can write your content in any text editor. Dillinger and Markdown Live are good online apps to see a live preview while working. If you really like using markdown, I really recommend checking out Typora . Unfortunately you can't install it on our computers. Bummer. ARTWORK Create at least one art/illustration piece to accompany your written content. The piece can be inspired by images you\u2019ve found in your research, but should be created by you. Any source images you use in the piece should be free for commercial use. Width of image should be set to 1000px.
