You can find your assigned research topic here. RESEARCH INFORMATION Create a folder in your google folder called Research Project . All of your research artifacts will go here. Things to collect include: information about topic & explanation writing to make sense of the information relevant imagery (save the images themselves and include links to sources) at least four web sources of information (include links to the sources) WRITTEN POST Using our research, you will create a written informational post explaining your topic in enough detail that a casual reader would understand. For the most part you will be explaining specialized vocabulary. Your written post will be at least four paragraphs long, but it will probably be longer. Focusing on capturing the important information, not paragraph count. Your written post will be formatted and saved as a markdown file , which is a special text file. You can use this file as a template for how to format your content. Since markdown is just a special text file, you can write your content in any text editor. Dillinger and Markdown Live are good online apps to see a live preview while working. If you really like using markdown, I really recommend checking out Typora . Unfortunately you can't install it on our computers. Bummer. ARTWORK Create at least one art/illustration piece to accompany your written content. The piece can be inspired by images you\u2019ve found in your research, but should be created by you. Any source images you use in the piece should be free for commercial use. Width of image should be set to 1000px.

Before the internet was invented computers were huge, bulky and practically immobile. The only way information could be sent digitally, was through telephone lines or magnetic computer tapes that had to send sent through the mail. In light of the Cold War the Department of Defense began to realize that their communication systems were susceptible to Russian attacks. In response to this threat the Department of Defense created a system of connected computers that became known as ARPAnet or the ARPA Network (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network.) This (at the time) obscure government research project would soon become the earliest version of the internet. The Beginning of the Internet While ARPAnet was an amazing invention it was currently only being used by the Department of Defense and a few other government agencies. So in October 1972 ARPAnet was publicly demonstrated for the first time at the International Computer Conference in Washington DC. This would eventually lead to the creation of the International Networking Group chaired by Vint Cerf. Then by 1975 the first official, public prototype was being tested. Eventually in 1978, after a few more years of testing, TCP/IPv4 was released. While many consider the birth of the internet to be in January 1983, when the Defense Data Network officially switched to the TCP/IP (Transport Control Protocol - Internet Protocol) standard. ARPAnet was an important step since it helped develop/create email, packet switching, and assisted in the creation of the TCP/IP. Further Development By 1998 there were over 750,000 commercial sites and businesses operating on the World Wide Web, but it wasn\u2019t an instant success. In the beginning, the internet only provided pages upon pages of text and it was often only available in one font and size. While some companies began to develop GUIs (graphical user interfaces) the internet was still quite bland. Arguably, one of the most important developments was Tim Berners Lee\u2019s development of the hypertext transfer protocol (http.) This protocol gave diverse computer platforms the ability to access the same websites as everyone else. Another important development included the development of the URL or Uniform Resource Locator. This made it much easier to find and access websites by creating a unique URL for every website. Then in the 1990\u2019s Tim Berners Lee brought this all together and created the World Wide Web. In 1991 web browsers and web server software first became available and by the end of 1992 there were approximately 26 websites in existence. Within 60 years this obscure government research project went from 0 to over 3.2 billion users.

A web host usually provide you with the tools necessary to make your own web online, sometimes this is known as a web host service provider. A web host also will help you set up a domain which is what you search in order to get to your website. Things you should expect from a web host is support for your web page and FTP access. Web clients Web client is how you are accessing the web (internet explorer, google chrome, firefox, god forbids safari and bing, etc). Web client and web server connects with each other and cannot exist without the other. To sum things up web client is a consumers application that sends a request to the servers and receives and projects a friendly interface for the end user. Web servers Web server is a hardware or software where information (files) are stored usually in the cloud or in HTTP servers units as HTML documents, depending on software and hardware. Everything search online is stored somewhere on a web server. An example is when you type in google.com it sends a request to the web server to retrieve the google file for the end user which in this case is you.

History With the introduction of images to the web in early 1991, the popularity and uses of the m as a digital tool are so far reaching that few websites do not use them. One of the first images put on the web was a Italian parody band by the name of Les Horribles Cernettes.

Forms of compression were and still are one of the most important methods of preserving storage and increasing buffering speeds.

Forms of compression were and still are one of the most important methods of preserving storage and increasing buffering speeds. The two forms of compression that are primarily used on the web are Lossy and Lossless Compression.

What Are Responsive Images? Responsive Images are Images that are able to expand or contract with the size of the webpage, allowing for more complete mobile experiences. This allows users on all platforms to adjust sites to a manageable size with ease, as well as viewing easier. Methods to go about doing this are simply adjusting in the HTML description of the image itself.
