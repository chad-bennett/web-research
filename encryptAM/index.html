<h3 id="how-does-it-work-turning-messages-into-secret-code">How  does it work? (turning messages into secret code)</h3>
<p>--based on the very  old art of (the science of making secret codes)--uses computers and sets  of computer instructions to turn plain text into an unreadable, jumbled  code. To (change secret codes into readable messages) that ciphertext  into plaintext, you need a number-based key to secretly code messages, a  series of bits that(change secret code into understandable language)  the text. The key is something only you or themeant receiver has in  their possession. Computers are capable of breaking (turned into secret  code) code by guessing a number-based key to secretly code messages, but  for very fancy (or smart) sets of computer instructions like an  elliptic curve set of computer instructions, this could take a very,  very long time.</p>
<p>If you send a secret/unreadable email, only the person with the  number-based key to secretly code messages can read it. If you're using a  secret/unreadable internet connection to shop online, your information  and credit card number are hidden from unauthorized users, like computer  criminals, illegal (secretly recording/watching people), or identity  thieves. If you (turn into secret code) data before syncing it with the  cloud, the cloud--or anyone breaking into it--can't read that data. But (turning messages into secret code) can be used for bad, too.  Ransomware attacks are becoming more common, also called denial of  service (DOS) attacks that use (turning messages into secret code)  software to lock users out of their computers until they pay a fee.</p>
<h2 id="whole-disks-">WHOLE DISKS-</h2>
<hr />
<p>Whole disk (turning messages into secret code), as the name hints,  refers to the (turning messages into secret code) of a whole physical or  logical disk. While this is now done mostly with software, hardware  based disk (turning messages into secret code) is a growing technology  which is expected to go past software products for whole disk (turning  messages into secret code) over the next few years. This form of  (turning messages into secret code) generally (turns into secret code)  the whole contents of a disk or volume and (changes secret codes into  readable messages)/encrypts it during use after a key has been given.  This means the data is protected from situations like laptop/disk loss  or theft where the data would be (turned into secret code)and require a  key to (change secret codes into readable messages). It would not  protect from situations like sending information over the network  (e-mail, websites, etc) or from situations where the (changing secret  codes into readable messages) key was already entered such as the user  walking away from their logged-in computer.     Single- user file/folder level- When an individual wishes to (turn into secret code) a single file or  group of files there are (more than two, but not a lot of) options. Most  (turning messages into secret code) software has the ability to (turn  into secret code) files individually using a password or other key. Many  (turning messages into secret code) programs have the ability to create  a secret/unreadable "virtual drive". This is a secret/unreadable file  that, when opened with the key, looks like another drive attached to the  computer allowing the user to easily open and save files into a  secret/unreadable area. Some other (online or paper forms that ask for a  job, money, admission, etc.), like MS Office And OpenOffice, have  built-in, single-file (turning messages into secret code) features. 2 </p>
<h2 id="multi-user-file-folder-level-">MULTI- User File/ Folder Level-</h2>
<hr />
<p>Allowing many users to (at the same time) access (turned into secret  code) information is more complicated than a single user. The (turning  messages into secret code) software must allow the use of either many  keys (i.e. one for each user) or a shared key (e.g. a shared password).  Also, the software must deal with multi-user file locking issues (this  is usually a problem with the virtual drive approach talked about/said  in the last section). </p>
<p>This approach can provide an added layer of protection against the  (telling to people/making known) of highly private data on file servers  in the event they are damaged/agreed. It can also help protect against  (telling to people/making known) on backup media as the files would  remain(turned into secret code) when backed up. </p>
<p>This approach can get complicated if not all users have the (turning  messages into secret code)software installed, or they are not configured  regularly (all the time). This could lead users being unable to access  secret/unreadable information or wrongly believing they have (turned  into secret code) information when they have not. For these reasons,  special attention should be paid to how (turning messages into secret  code) software behaves and users should be educated to recognize the  (turning messages into secret code) status of files.</p>
<h2 id="database-">DATABASE-</h2>
<p>(turning into secret code) information in a (computer file full of  information) can be done at a couple of levels. The computer program  (using/getting to) the (computer file full of information)can (turn into  secret code) information before putting it into the (computer file full  of information). This needs/demands intelligence at the application  level, but no added/more(computer file full of information) features.  Many (computer files full of information) have built-in(turning messages  into secret code) functions which computer programs can use to (turn  into secret code) data as it is written. This usually needs/demands  features at both the computer program and (computer file full of  information) level. A (turning messages into secret code)computer  program can sit between the computer program and (computer file full of  information), (turn into secret code)ing/decrypting information as it is  written and read. This Needs/demands buying and installing added/more  software, but may not require changes to the computer program or  (computer file full of information). </p>
<p>DB (combined different things together so they worked as one unit) (turning messages into secret code) DB backed application level (turning messages into secret code)</p>
<h2 id="application-level-">Application Level-</h2>
<p>As talked about/said earlier, some computer programs that aren't  specifically designed for(turning messages into secret code) do have  basic (turning messages into secret code) functions. Especially, common  working well and getting a lot done suites like Microsoft Office and  OpenOffice contain file (turning messages into secret code) features. Be  careful of the quality of the built-in (turning messages into secret  code) features, even within the Microsoft Office product line, some  versions (like Office 2007) have a good (machine/method/way), others  have poor ones(like Office 2000 and earlier) and still others require  proper setup to provide good protection (like Office 2003). These  features can be very (conveniently nearby/useful) because they don't  require added/more licenses, require less training and can be effective  for both traveling and at rest(turning messages into secret code). Also,  they can work well for file exchange since the receiver is more likely  to have the ability to (change secret codes into readable messages) the  file. In short, built-in (turning messages into secret code) functions  can be convenient options, but you should research their effectiveness  before using them.</p>
<h2 id="email-messages-">Email Messages-</h2>
<p>There are a couple of different levels to (turning messages into  secret code) with email, first is(turning into secret code) just a  political helpers file and second is (turning into secret code) a whole  message. (turning into secret code) a political helpers file can be  completed using a single-file (turning messages into secret code)  process that "sticks" to the file. Naturally, the receiver must have a  way of (changing secret codes into readable messages) the file. There  are only a couple of commonly used email message (turning messages into  secret code)technologies, especially S/MIME and PGP. While S/MIME  support is (having different things working together as one unit) into  many email clients, it needs/demands users to have trusted certificates  which can be complicated to properly send out and use. Using PGP to  (turn into secret code) email needs/demands installing software, but  there are both free and commercial options. </p>
<p>Both of these technologies also allow for digital "signing" of email  without (turning into secret code) it. This signing process allows the  receiver to be certain a message was not changed traveling, but does not  protect the content from prying eyes. </p>
<p>PGP/GnuPG Email clients with (combined different things together so they worked as one unit) S/MIME support</p>
<h2 id="network-traffic-">Network Traffic-</h2>
<p>(turning into secret code) information while traveling on a network  is one of the most common, and important, uses of (turning messages into  secret code). One of the most popular forms of this (turning messages  into secret code) is Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer  Security(TLS), commonly used to (turn into secret code) web traffic  traveling. Any web computer program that transmits or collects sensitive  information should (turn into secret code) the information using  SSL/TLS. There are some other uses for SSL/TLS (turning messages into  secret code), including securing (verifying someone's identity) for  email communication between clients and servers. SSL/TLS can also be  used for "tunneling" to (turn into secret code) other forms of network  transmission that don't have their own (turning messages into secret  code) features. </p>
<p>Another common network (turning messages into secret code) technology  is Secure Shell (SSH) which is mostly used for secret/unreadable  terminal connections (replacing telnet) and (turned into secret code)  file moves (from one place to another) (SFTP replacing FTP). Like  SSL/TLS, SSH can also be used for tunneling. </p>
<p>A more general form of network traffic (turning messages into secret  code) is IP Security (IPSec), which operates at a more basic layer than  SSL or SSH and can be applied to any network traffic. However, using  IPSec needs/demands common setup between the two computers  communicating, so it is generally used within a company/department  rather than across the internet. </p>
<p>For wireless networks there are other (turning messages into secret  code) options that only (turn into secret code) information between the  computer and the wireless access point. For this reason, they only  protect from (secretly watching and recording) on wireless and not after  the information leaves the access point onto a wired network. The two  most common forms are called Wired Equal Privacy (WEP) and WiFI  Protected Access (WPA). WEP is no longer carefully thought  about/believed a secure rules of conduct. WPA is much stronger, but has  faults/problems and an updated WPA2 standard has been released which  improves its security.</p>
